SolidusCatalogMode
==================

This extension allow the user to set products not for online sale.  
In this way we could use Solidus to show only the catalog of our products,
without the online store functionality.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_catalog_mode to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_catalog_mode'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_catalog_mode:install
```

Usage
-------

This gem adds a boolean field to the products and to the stores.
In this way you could set a single product or the complete store to be in "catalog mode".
Then in your store frontend you can use this information to disable the link to the cart,
the price and the cart form in the product page.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_catalog_mode/factories'
```
